# Conventional Commits

## Summary
A specification for standardizing commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history.

## Structure
With conventional conventions, commit messages are structured as follows:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types
| **type** | **description**                                                                                                                                           | **emoji** |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| build    | Related specifically to changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.                                                                    | üõ†        |
| chore    | Denotes changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation, project build, or package manager configurations. | ‚ôªÔ∏è        |
| ci       | Stands for changes to CI configuration files and scripts.                                                                                                 | ‚öôÔ∏è        |
| docs     | Signifies changes to the documentation only.                                                                                                              | üìö        |
| feat     | Indicates a new feature for the user.                                                                                                                     | ‚ú®         |
| fix      | Used when fixing a bug for the user.                                                                                                                      | üêõ        |
| perf     | Used for changes that improve performance.                                                                                                                | üöÄ        |
| refactor | Indicates a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.                                                                                      | üì¶        |
| style    | Refers to changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.).                                        | üíé        |
| test     | Applies to commits that add missing tests or correct existing tests.                                                                                      | üö®        |

## Breaking Changes
Breaking changes are declared by including `BREAKING CHANGE: <message>` in the footer of the commit message. Optionally, you can signify a breaking change by including a `!` after the commit type.

## Examples
### Commit message with description and breaking change footer
```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

### Commit message with `scope` and `!` to draw attention to breaking change

```
chore(web)!: drop support for Node 6

BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript feature not available in Node 6.
```

### Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers
```
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are obsolete now
