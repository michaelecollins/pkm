## Structure
With conventional conventions, commit messages are structured as follows:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types
| **type** | **description**                                                                                                                                           | **emoji** |

## Breaking Changes
Breaking changes are declared by including `BREAKING CHANGE: <message>` in the footer of the commit message. Optionally, you can signify a breaking change by including a `!` after the commit type.

## Examples
### Commit message with description and breaking change footer
```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

### Commit message with `scope` and `!` to draw attention to breaking change

```
chore(web)!: drop support for Node 6

BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript feature not available in Node 6.
```

### Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers
```
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are obsolete now
